Hi! My name is Tim O’Brien, and I’m currently a senior at Vanderbilt University triple majoring in Computer Science, Applied Math, and French. Ever since I was little, I’ve been really into problem-solving, which led me to math competitions in middle and high school. Once I discovered programming, I knew it was a natural fit as it allows me the opportunity to solve challenging problems every single day. I'm really passionate about spreading my love for programming, so I work on-campus as a teaching assistant for an upper-level CS class as well as helping to organize a yearly hackathon as part of VandyHacks. Last summer, I worked at a startup on a variety of projects. I helped revamp the development environment using Docker, created a mail tracking system for printed checks, added automatic email notifications to the internal portal, and much more. In the future, I'm hoping to go into backend development, since I particularly enjoy coming up with and implementing algorithms to solve lots of different kinds of problems.
