Hi! My name is Tim O’Brien, and I’m currently a junior at Vanderbilt triple majoring in Computer Science, Applied Math, and French. Ever since I was little, I’ve been really into problem-solving, which led me from math competitions in middle and high school to, ever since starting college, aspiring to be a software engineer so that I can solve challenging problems every day. I'm really passionate about spreading my love for programming, so I work on-campus as a teaching assistant for an upper-level CS class as well as helping to organize CS events and a yearly hackathon for VandyHacks. Last summer, I worked at a startup developing an internal portal using Angular and TypeScript to allow their support team to see everything going on inside a customer’s cloud deployment. One of our goals was to make the portal as secure as possible, adding multiple levels of authentication, view-only access, and additional safeguards. I really enjoyed working as a full-stack engineer last summer because it allowed me to solve problems on both the front and back end. This summer, I'd like to take a deeper look at the back end because I particularly enjoy coming up with and implementing algorithms to solve lots of different kinds of problems.
