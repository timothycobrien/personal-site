# Personal Site

This is a personal site made with Gatsby.js.

I have an awful eye for design, so I decided to use a Gatsby template I liked online (credits below).
This made it a whole ton easier to just focus on the content of the site and not have to think so much about design.
I might try for a few more modifications in the future with respect to the presentation, but this works really well for now.
